# The Fediverse/Meta Drama

If you have an irrational hate for companies and despise Meta, don't read this
article\! You'll get irrationally mad\! You have been warned\!

**Note**: This article is mostly a copy-paste of my Mastodon thread, so it's
not really well written. You can follow the thread at https://hachyderm.io/@diamond/110567418571811538.

*Begin excerpt*

Suspicion and concern *\[towards Meta\]*, yes, but I think people are treating
this like Meta is *purchasing* the community or something akin to that.

It's going to be just another instance. Others can defederate if it becomes an
issue; that has always been what we do with far worse (e.g., alt-right)
instances\!

Nothing has even happened yet, though. Nothing that would justify hostility
towards both Meta and other developers working on the project.

I suppose my main point is that I don't get all the sudden hostility coming
from *everyone* when things have barely even happened.

Yes, the NDA sucks, and it's really stupid that things are happening behind the
curtains. But does that matter?

The code is open source, the platform is moderated independently, and there are
dozens of alternatives. What's to worry about when nothing has even happened
yet?

Also y'all harassed a core developer off the Fediverse? Seriously?

*End excerpt*

The developer being harassed off the Fediverse is too nasty. That's way too
nasty. Hey, you people *harassed a core developer off the platform that they
contributed so much towards*\! And for what? For them having good-will and
thinking that their actions are benefiting the greater good?

I remember there was a toot pushing for Meta defederation, that Fediverse
apparently has problems with transphobia, racism, anti-semetism, and a bunch of
other issues. Getting Meta federated might not solve these problems, but hey,
I'm sure harassing a developer off the platform is going to help\!

This is absolutely insane.
